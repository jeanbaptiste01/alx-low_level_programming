F1, 0-binary_to_uint.c

This function takes a binary string as input and converts it to an unsigned integer. If the input is invalid (NULL or contains characters other than '0' and '1'), it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the decimal value of the binary number.

F2, 1-print_binary.c

The function print_binary takes an unsigned long integer n as input and recursively prints its binary representation. It uses bitwise operations to extract each bit of the number and _putchar function to print the binary digits. The recursion continues until the entire binary representation is printed. The function is declared in the "main.h" header file.
